This project was developed as the final assignment for the C++ course, focusing on advanced C++ concepts. It built upon our knowledge from the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course, also taught in C++. The game was created using QtQuick and was a collaborative team effort. While the project has its imperfections, I've chosen to keep it in this GitHub repository to showcase the progress I've made since then.

For a more refined and polished project, I recommend checking out my other project, Asteroids, which I'm currently developing solo. I'm much more satisfied with the code quality of that project, although it's still a work in progress.

Gameplay:

Controls:

Movement: WASD
Shooting: Arrow keys
Opening inventory: I (The game is localized in Czech, but the inventory remains in English for better navigation. If the player owns a weapon or armor, they cannot pick up items of the same type. Additionally, the player can heal in the inventory.)
Healing: H (if the player owns health potions)
Objective:

At the beginning, the player must interact with an NPC to receive a quest.
The kill count is displayed below, and the player must eliminate all monsters to complete the quest.
Once all monsters are defeated, the player returns to the NPC to complete the game.
NPC Interaction:

The dialogue with the NPC changes based on the status of the quest.
Item Collection:

The player can collect items by pressing E.
Upon killing a monster, there's a chance for a healing item to drop.
Menu Functionality:

The game features a pause menu accessible by pressing the Escape key.
